# smaller_projects

## Description
This repository is a collection of smaller projects that I have created for university coursework, personal training, or as components of larger projects. Each project serves as a practical exercise in implementing various algorithms, mathematical concepts, or problem-solving techniques.

The goal of this repository is to showcase a range of skills, including algorithm design, optimization, and domain-specific applications such as financial modeling, number theory, and graph-based problems.

## Contents
Below is a brief overview of the projects currently included in this repository:

1. **Prime Number Tools**
   - Programs for generating prime numbers and testing primality.
   - Includes implementations of probabilistic tests like the Fermat primality test and deterministic methods.
   - Applications in number theory and cryptography.

2. **Mersenne Number Finder**
   - Tools to identify and verify Mersenne primes (`M_p = 2^p - 1`, where `p` is prime).
   - Useful for exploring mathematical properties of special prime numbers.

3. **Arbitrage Detection with Floyd-Warshall**
   - Implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to detect arbitrage opportunities in currency exchange rates.
   - Demonstrates applications of graph theory in financial modeling.

4. **Fibonacci Algorithm Comparison**
   - Implementation of three different algorithms for finding the n-th Fibonacci number
   - Comparison of the speed of the algorithms

6. **(More Projects Coming Soon)**
   - Additional projects will include a variety of algorithms, data structures, and domain-specific tools, with focus areas including:
     - Graph algorithms
     - Financial modeling tools
     - Mathematical utilities
